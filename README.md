## Overview

This project evaluates GPT-4-Turbo's performance in translating biomedical abstracts across 12 language pairs. The study compares GPT-4-Turbo with commercial translation systems such as Google Translate and DeepL, utilizing the **Biomedical Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) Dataset.**  

**Key Highlights:**  
- Evaluates translation quality using automatic metrics: **BLEU, CHRF++, and TER.**  
- Translations performed using APIs for **GPT-4, Google Translate, and DeepL.**  
- Human evaluation conducted for Pt ⇒ En translations.

## Project Structure
- `src/main.py` – Main script to run the translation pipeline.
- `src/evaluation.py` – Handles automated evaluation using BLEU, CHRF++, and TER metrics.
- `src/translation.py` – Manages the core translation logic and calls apropiate API functions.
- `src/utils/api_utils.py` – Manages API requests for translation services (GPT-4, Google, DeepL).
- `alignment_files/` – Contains data used for aligning parallel translation texts.
- `evaluation_files/` – Stores evaluation reports and analysis results.
- `parallel_files/` – Holds the bilingual text pairs used for translation testing.
- `result_files/` – Stores translated files generated by each API.

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kahmeeah/GPT4-Biomedical-MT.git
    cd GPT4-Biomedical-MT
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Configure APIs in a ```.env``` file:
   ```bash
   PROJECT_ID=your_key # google translate project id
   GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/your/file.json
   GOOGLE_key=your_key
   DEEPL_AUTH_KEY=your_key
   OPENAI_KEY=your_key
   OPENAI_MODEL=your_model
   ```

5. Run the program:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Results

The study found that GPT-4-Turbo demonstrates strong potential for biomedical translations but lags behind specialized NMT systems in some language pairs. Further manual evaluation is recommended for more conclusive findings.
